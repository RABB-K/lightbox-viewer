# üñºÔ∏è Simple Lightbox Viewer

A minimal **lightbox image viewer** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Click on any gallery thumbnail to open a full-size image in an overlay modal. Click the close button or anywhere outside the image to close the lightbox.

---

## Features

- Click thumbnails to open the full-size image in a lightbox.
- Close the lightbox by clicking the close button (`X`).
- Close the lightbox by clicking anywhere outside the image.
- Simple and easy-to-understand JavaScript logic.
- Uses CSS `display: flex` to show/hide the lightbox.

---

##  How It Works

1. The script selects all `.gallery-item` elements.
2. When a thumbnail is clicked:
   - The lightbox container becomes visible (`display: flex`).
   - The full-size image URL is generated by removing `-thumbnail` from the thumbnail source.
   - The large image is displayed inside the lightbox.
3. Clicking the close button or anywhere on the lightbox hides the lightbox.
